a = 10
b = 4
c = 2
d = 3

print(a+b/c**d)

# Observations:
# The print statement is the same as 10 + (4/2^3) if you were doing regular math.
# The reason why the output is 10.5 is because this is the correct order of operations 
# for mathematics (i.e., exponent first, then division, then addition/subtraction)
